* This folder contains the **modified** source files (only) from the demo projects. This is not stand-alone.

* For the 'power_measurement' project, only the 'power_measure.cc' file is modified. Only that file is uploaded with variations. It has to be copied (replacing the original file) into the 'power_measurement' project and built with CCS. 

* Note that specific information/parameters/configurations still have to be changed in the code. For example, the IP address of server, port numbers, packet sizes, traffic frequency, etc should be changes as required. 

* Organization: Parent demo project -> branch (modified) project
