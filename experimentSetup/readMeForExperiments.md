## Note the following during experiments:

1. Always close the serial connection to the SimpleLink device (through a terminal like MobaXterm) before attempting to burn the image.
2. Make sure the country code is set to US (or the country you are in) in UniFlash/CCS (image.syscfg) before burning. Frequency bands are different between regions.
3. Before burning an image to CC3235SF, disconnect any other SimpleLink device (like CC3200).
